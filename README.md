# Example Code: Settings Page - Better Implementation v1

*__This example code is part of the article: [Using A Config To Write Reusable Code](https://www.alainschlesser.com/config-files-for-reusable-code/)__*

This is more of a real OOP implementation of a settings page using the WordPress Settings API. In addition to the previous example, it uses a Config file to make the `SettingsPage` class truly reusable.

To test this plugin yourself, clone the repository into a `wp-content/plugins` folder of a WordPress installation, and run the command `composer install` from within the plugin's folder to generate the autoloader. You should then be able to activate the plugin and get access to the generated settings page via `Settings` &rarr; `as-settings-better-v1`.

Clicking on this menu entry will bring you to the generated Settings page, which allows you to save two useless settings.
